# Introduction

The Lifesigns Engine is written in Ruby and is a framework for creating
interactive stories or text adventure games. The items and functionality
contained aim to represent the real world using text. The inspiration for this
project is [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) - but with a focus on the
command-line.

# Dependencies

By default, the Lifesigns Engine should not require anything except Ruby to
function correctly, but for testing and debugging purposes, a test suite is
included and it is optional for users to install the `minitest` Ruby Gem or not.
The game engine will still function correctly without it, but you will not be
able to run any tests of the game assets.
