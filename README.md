# Introduction

The Lifesigns Engine is written in Ruby and is a framework for creating
interactive stories or text adventure games. There is a collection of items and
a lot of functionality bundled, which aims to represent the real world using
text. The primary inspiration for this project is
[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) - it is my intention that a user of this
software can create a game or a story based on the command-line quickly and with
a high-emphasis on quality.
