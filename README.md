# Introduction

The Lifesigns Engine is written in Ruby and is a framework for creating
interactive stories or text adventure games. The items and functionality
contained aim to represent the real world using text. The inspiration for this
project is [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) - but with a focus on the
command-line.
